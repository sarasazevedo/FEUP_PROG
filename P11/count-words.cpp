/*
Write a C++ function
void count_words(const string& str, vector<pair<string, size_t>>& count)
that receives as parameters a string and a vector, and fills the vector with (ùë§,ùëõ)
 pairs, where ùë§
 is a word appearing in string and ùëõ
 is the the number of occurrences of ùë§
, ordered alphabetically by word. Consider the words to be case insensitive.
Include the following function, show_vector, to print the contents of the vector in the test cases.
void show_vector(const vector<pair<string, size_t>>& count) {
  cout << "[ ";
  for (const auto& e : count) {
    cout << e.first << ":" << e.second << ' ';
  }
  cout << "]\n";
