Dip dah ooh yeah
Dip dah ooh yeah
Dip dah ooh yeah
Dip dah ooh yeah

You say you love me but you never beep me
You always promise but you never date me
I try to fax but it's busy, always
I try the network but you crash the gateways

You never spend your nights with me
And you don't go out with other girls either
You only love your collider

I fill you screen with hearts and roses
I fill your mail file with lovely phrases
They all come back: invalid user
You never let me into your computer

You never spend your nights with me
And you don't go out with other girls either
You prefer your collider

I gave you golden ring to show you my love
You went to stick it in a printed circuit
To fix a voltage leak in your collector
You plug my feelings into your detector

You never spend your nights with me
And you don't go out with other girls either
You only love your collider
Your collider
Your collider
